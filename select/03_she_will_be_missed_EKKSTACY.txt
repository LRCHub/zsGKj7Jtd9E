You're off me
She will be missed
Everything that we did
It's gone like we didn't
And I can't move on
You don't wanna come
No, I
I'm not taking time from her
I regret so much I've done
I'm not choosing a side, I'm not choosing
Oh, you've already chose for me
I'm stuck in your cold, I'm freezing
And I can't move on
You don't wanna come
No, I
I'm not taking time from her
Ooh, ooh
No, I
No, I
And I can't move on
You don't wanna come
No, I
I'm not taking time from her
