Your hair looks like
It's falling out
Left in the comb
It won't come off
Your head hangs low
Your legs get weak
Leftovers on the tabletop

And I'm so stressed out yeah

You lift your arms
Over your head
And run your fingers
Through what's left
You eye's tear up
Your stomach burns
Your upside down
Start to invert

And I'm so stressed out yeah
Invert

So yo keep on living
But everything still falls apart
Keep bing who your being
And it keeps on fallng out

Save yourself
I'm on my last nerve
Save your self
Put on your best swerve
Save yourself
I'm on my last nerve
Save yourself
Self-served

Save yourself
Save yourself
