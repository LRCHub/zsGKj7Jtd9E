[00:12.11] I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
[00:15.04] I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
[00:17.90] I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
[00:20.64] I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
[00:23.42] I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink
[00:25.77] But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
[00:28.01] My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
[00:33.63] My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
[00:40.72] Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
[00:46.53] When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (oh)
[00:52.11] Wish we could turn back time (oh) to the good old days (oh)
[00:57.64] When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[01:07.18] We're stressed out
[01:14.20] Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
[01:16.88] How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
[01:19.88] I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
[01:21.95] Try to sell it, never sell, out of it, I'd probably only sell one
[01:25.44] It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
[01:27.69] Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
[01:31.24] But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
[01:33.41] That of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter
[01:36.79] My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
[01:42.95] My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
[01:49.82] Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
[01:55.92] When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (oh)
[02:02.04] Wish we could turn back time (oh) to the good old days (oh)
[02:06.98] When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[02:12.24] Used to play pretend, give each other different names
[02:14.48] We would build a rocket ship, and then we'd fly it far away
[02:17.04] Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
[02:19.94] Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money," yeah
[02:22.89] We used to play pretend, give each other different names
[02:25.29] We would build a rocket ship, and then we'd fly it far away
[02:28.35] Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
[02:30.95] Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money," yeah
[02:35.31] Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
[02:41.03] When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (oh)
[02:46.46] Wish we could turn back time (oh) to the good old days (oh)
[02:52.05] When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[02:57.20] Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
[02:59.67] We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
[03:02.63] Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
[03:05.48] We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
[03:08.28] Used to play pretend, give each other different names
[03:10.91] We would build a rocket ship, and then we'd fly it far away
[03:13.56] Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
[03:16.36] Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money," yeah
