[00:17.66] You're off me
[00:22.81] She will be missed
[00:28.26] Everything that we did
[00:33.58] It's gone, like we didn't
[00:46.08] 
[00:38.86] And I can't move on
[00:43.15] You don't wanna come
[00:48.83] No
[00:51.44] I, I'm not taking time from her
[00:59.80] (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
[01:06.80] 
[01:05.89] I regret so much I've done
[01:10.64] I'm not choosing a side
[01:12.09] I'm not choosing a side you've already chose for me
[01:16.43] I'm stuck in your cold, I'm freezing
[01:34.43] 
[01:22.28] And I can't move on
[01:26.41] You don't wanna come
[01:32.16] No I, I'm not taking time from her
[01:43.35] (Ooh, ooh)
[01:48.66] (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[01:56.16] 
[01:54.02] Oh, oh
[01:59.55] I, I
[02:01.55] 
[02:05.63] And I can't move on
[02:09.82] You don't wanna come
[02:15.64] No I, I'm not taking time from her
